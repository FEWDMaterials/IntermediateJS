### HELLO, WROLD!

Welcome to the *Intermediate JavaScript Workshop*! Today we will programming concepts and topics in javascript that will teach you how to write clean, reusable code. 

#### In a nutshell

These are our three main objectives for today:

1. Learn about the functional fundamentals of JavaScript.
2. Learn about object oriented fundamentals of JavaScript.
3. Learn about popular design patterns used in writing JS code.

#### Game plan 

Ok so here is what we will *really* be doing...

<b>OBJECTIVE</b>: recreate jQuery. <br>
<b>WHY</b>: 

* We use jQuery (most likely) every single day. 
* It is the single most popular javascript library on earth today (for now, anyways). 
* But what would happen if jQuery was inaccessible or we were not allowed to use it?

<b> We will explore how the main objectives -- quite abstract principles -- come into play as we implement something quite abstract -- a library that handles DOM manipulation.</b>

##### Implementing the $('.selector') function

1. Literally with just literals
2. The constructor pattern and you
3. Object.create() -- started from the bottom, now we here
